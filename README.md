# simple-ai-strategy-client

A re-implementation of [`simple-ai-client`](https://github.com/civ-clone/simple-ai-client) using the `Strategy`s of
[`core-strategy`](https://github.com/civ-clone/core-strategy). This is "just" a collection that includes all the
`core-` and `base-` packages to be able to easily include the components via one package and the tests to ensure it
performs the same function as that which it is re-implementing.

This might actually be better named as `civ1-strategy-ai-client`.
